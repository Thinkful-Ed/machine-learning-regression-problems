    "# Evaluating Goodness of Fit of Linear Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've learned how to build a linear regression model and interpret the estimated coefficients. In this checkpoint, we discuss how we evaluate the performance of our models in the training phase. Recall that we can talk about two broad types of performances: one in the training set and the other in the test set. The former enables us to talk about how well our model explains the information in the target variable and the later gives us an idea about how well our model will perform when it's given previously unseen observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we start with the investigation of whether an estimated model deems better than a reduced model. By reduced model, we mean a model with no features. To compare our model with the reduced model, we use **F-test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we delve into the measurement of how well our model explains the variance in the target variable. To this end, we talk about **R-squared** and **adjusted R-squared**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we explain how we can compare different models in terms of their explanatory power. We show how to read **Akaike** and **Bayesian** information criterias for this purpose."

    "#### The F-test\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-test can be calculated in different ways depending on the situation, but principally represents the ratio between the unexplained variance of our model and the unexplained variance of a reduced model to which our model is compared.  Here, the \"reduced model\" is a model with no features, meaning all variance in the outcome is unexplained.  For a linear regression model with two parameters $y=\\alpha+\\beta x$, the F-test is built from these pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "* unexplained model variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SSE_F=\\sum(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* unexplained variance in reduced model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SSE_R=Var_y = \\sum(y_i-\\bar{y})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    " * number of parameters in the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_F = 2 (\\alpha \\text{ and } \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    " * number of parameters in the reduced model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_R = 1 (\\alpha)$$\n",
    "\n",
    " * number of datapoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n$$\n",
    "\n",
    " * degrees of freedom of $SSE_F$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$df_F = n - p_F$$\n",
    "\n",
    " * degrees of freedom of $SSE_R$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$df_R = n - p_R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These pieces come together to give us the full equation for the F-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F=\\dfrac{SSE_F-SSE_R}{df_F-df_R}÷\\dfrac{SSE_F}{df_F}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces some new terminology. **Degrees of freedom** quantify the amount of information \"left over\" to estimate variability after all parameters are estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, degrees of freedom for a function works like this:  With two datapoints, a regression line $y=\\alpha + \\beta x$ has 0 degrees of freedom (2 minus the number of parameters).  Those two parameters encompass all the information in the data.  Knowing $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ alone, we can perfectly reproduce the original data.  No additional information is available from the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypotheses of the F-test states that the model is indifferent from the reduced model which means that the features contributes nothing to the explanation of the target variable. Instead of reading the F statistics, it's easier to read the p-value of it. The lesser the p-value, the better for our model. Namely, if the p-value of the F test for our model is less than or equal to 0.1 (or even less than or equal to 0.05), we say that our model is useful and contributes something that is statistically significant in the explanation of the target.\n",

    "R-squared is probably the most common measure of goodness of fit in a linear regression model. It is a proportion (between 0 and 1) that expresses how much variance in the outcome variable is explained by the explanatory variables in the model. Generally speaking, higher $R^2$ values are better to a point-- a low $R^2$ indicates that our model isn't explaining much information about the outcome, which means it will not give very good predictions. However, a very high $R^2$ is a warning sign for overfitting.  No dataset is a perfect representation of reality, so a model that perfectly fits our data ($R^2$ of 1 or close to 1) is likely to be biased by quirks in the data, and will perform less well on the test-set.\n",

If our model is too complex for the data, then it may overfit the training set and does a poor job in the test set. **To assess this, we need to evaluate the performance of our model in the test set and see whether our model does a significantly poor job in the test set compared to the training set**.

Adjusted R-squared does the same job with the R-squared but it is adjusted according to the number of features included to the model.

Both of these information criterias take into consideration the sum of the squared errors (SSE), the sample size and the number of parameters.\n",
