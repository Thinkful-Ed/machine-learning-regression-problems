    "The strength of multiple linear regression lies in its ability to provide straightforward and interpretable solutions that not only predict future outcomes, but also provide insight into the underlying processes that create these outcomes. One of the reasons why linear regression models are so commonplace is the fact that these models can shed light on the relationships in the data by just interpreting the estimated coefficients. The interpretation of the relationships by looking at the estimated coefficients is called **inference**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this checkpoint, we learn to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much an increase in an explanatory variable does affect the explained variable?\n",
    "* How can we single out the effect of a specific variable by isolating the affects of other variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to these questions bear a lot of business value. Think about a company that likes to measure the performance of its advertising expenditures. Is radio advertisements are more effective in attracting new customers than the Facebook ads? For a thousand dollars spent on TV ads, how many products does the company sell? And, how can we distinguish whether the new customers are the result of the TV ads or the Google ads?"

    "## Interpreting the constant\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants in linear regression models corresponds to the outcome value that is expected to happen when all the explanatory variables take zero value. In a simple linear regression setting (when there is only a single explanatory variable), constant corresponds to the point the fitted curve crosses the y-axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's easy to visualize the constant term in simple linear regression settings, it gets harder to grasp what a constant term means if there are many features included in the model. For example, if a dummy variable is included in a model, then one category should be excluded from the model as we explained before. In this case, constant term also includes information regarding the hould out category. Hence, a lot of factors may be captured by the constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The safest way to think about the constant term is to think of it as the bias. Remember that in the previous checkpoint we said that the constant terms make the residuals zero on average. In this sense, the constant takes the bias from residuals to itself. This is why the constant is also called bias!\n"
