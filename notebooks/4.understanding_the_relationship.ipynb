    "The strength of multiple linear regression lies in its ability to provide straightforward and interpretable solutions that not only predict future outcomes, but also provide insight into the underlying processes that create these outcomes. One of the reasons why linear regression models are so commonplace is that simply by interpreting estimated coeffcients, they can shed light on an underlying relationship. The process of interpreting the relationship between estimated coefficients and outcomes is called **inference**.\n",

    "Estimating parameters in a linear regression model does not guarantee that the estimated coefficients are statistically significant!\n",
    "\n",
    "When estimating a parameter, the ultimate objective is to find its true value in the population. More often than not, we need to work with a sample rather than the actual population, and we estimate the coefficients using a sample. For an individual coefficient to be **statistically significant**, it must have a non-zero value (otherwise it contributes nothing to the equation), and it must help explain variance in outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **t-tests** to determine if an individual coefficient estimate is significantly different from zero. This is a way of quantifying a measure of *unique* variance in the outcome as a function of the parameter, *after controlling for the variance explained by the other parameters*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![t_test](../assets/t_test.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in a linear regression with the yellow circle as the outcome, the total variance explained by the model is represented by the intersection of the yellow, blue, and pink feature circles. However, the statistical test of the significance of the blue circle will be done on *only* the green area where blue and yellow overlap, ignoring the area of shared overlap among blue, pink, and yellow. Similarly, the statistical test of the significance of the pink circle will be done on *only* the orange area where the pink and yellow overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-significant parameter does not contribute new information about the outcome variable, and can be discarded with little to no decrease in the model's explanatory power. Moreover, we should treat statistically insignificant coefficients as if they are zero in interpreting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we estimate a linear regression model using statsmodels, the `summary()` function returns t-statistics and associated p values. **P-values** are easier are easier to read than t-values. The p-value associated with a t-test quantifies the likelihood that the estimated coefficient is actually equal to zero in the real population. The lower the p-value, the more significant the coefficient is. As a general rule of thumb, when the p-value of a coefficient is less than or equal to 0.1, we say that the coefficient is statistically significant. However, it's admirable to have a p-value that is less than or equal to 0.05.\n"

In the dataset, we have two continuous variables: age and bmi (body mass index). In this new model, we add them besides the \"is_male\" and \"is_smoker\" dummies as explanatory variables. "

When we estimate the coefficients of a model using OLS, we actually get coefficient estimates that are isolated from each other. That is to say, the coefficient of a feature measures the effect of that variable on the outcome variable by holding all other variables constant at their means. So, we can interpret an estimated coefficient as the measure of the relationship between that feature and the target after stripping out the affects of all other features. "

    "Consider the coefficients of the dummy variables in (eq.1). The coefficient of is_male is −109.04, and the coefficient of is_smoker is 23833.87. Moreover, we see that the p-value of is_smoker is very close to zero whereas the p-value of is_male is 0.745. This implies that the coefficient of is_male is effectively zero from a statistical point of view. It's simply not significant and we can say that there appears to be no relationship between medical costs and biological sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an okay hunch but requires further confirmation. It's possible that model equation may play some role in this conclusion. We'll see later in this checkpoint that by including including an additional variable in the model, the coefficient of is_male can be made statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, smoking is a significant factor in the medical costs charged. According to our estimation, the medical costs of smoking males are $23,833.87 dollars more than female smokers __on average__."

    "Now, let's interpret the coefficients of the continuous variables in (eq.1). First, both age and bmi variables are statistically significant as the p-values are very close to zero. The coefficient of age is 259.45. As a person's age increases by one year, her/his costs increase by \\$259.45 dollars on average. Similarly, as BMI increases by one point, medical costs increase by \\$323.05 dollars on average.\n",

    "**Note:** Sometimes, transforming the target and features can lead to a clearer interpretation. For example, if we take the logarithms of a target and a feature and estimate the model after that, we can interpret the \"coefficient\" of that feature like this: a percantage increase in the value of the original feature (not log transformed) results in the \"coefficient\" percentage change in the original target (not log transformed). If you wonder why this is the case, you can read this [stackoverflow question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/244199/why-is-it-that-natural-log-changes-are-percentage-changes-what-is-about-logs-th).\n",

    "## Interpreting interaction between features\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've interpreted categorical and continuous variables one at a time. But sometimes we need to model **interactions** in order to best explain outcomes. By putting interaction variables in a linear regression model we can capture non-linear relationships between the target and the features. For example, from (eq.1) we know the difference of average costs between smokers and non-smokers. However, if we believe that the costs of smokers would increase as the bmi of a person increases (because the probability of having a heart attack increases) more than the non-smokers, we need to add the interaction of bmi and the is_smoker dummy to the model.\n",

Since the interaction of bmi and smoking is not included in this model, the estimated value represents an averaged figure for bmi. The green line is the relationship we estimated in (eq.2) between the charges and bmi for non-smokers and the orange line represents the relationship between charges and bmi for smokers. As we see, the increase in charges with an increase in bmi is higher for smokers than non-smokers. Because of the interaction term in (eq.2), we can now distinguish the effects of an increase in bmi on charges between smokers and non-smokers. Notice that the blue line lies between the green and the orange lines as it measures the averaged effect of bmi on charges both for smokers and non-smokers."

    "## Interpreting the constant\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants in linear regression models correspond to the outcome value that is expected to happen when all the explanatory variables take a zero value. In a simple linear regression setting (when there is only a single explanatory variable), constants correspond to the point the fitted curve crosses the y-axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's easy to visualize the constant term in simple linear regression settings, it gets harder to grasp what a constant term means if there are many features included in the model. For example, if a dummy variable is included in a model, then one category should be excluded from the model as we explained before. In this case, the constant term also includes information regarding the holdout category. Hence, a lot of factors may be captured by the constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The safest way to think about the constant term is to think of it as the bias. Remember that in the previous checkpoint we said that the constant terms make the residuals zero on average. In this sense, the constant takes the bias from residuals to itself. This is why the constant is also called bias!\n"
